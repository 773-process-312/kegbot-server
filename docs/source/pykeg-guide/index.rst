===========

Pykeg is Kegbot's legacy frontend and "core" controller.  It is a collection of
command-line programs that talk to the Kegbot hardware and server. Though it is
no longer actively developed (since it has been supplanted by the Kegbot Android
app), Pykeg is supported in maintenance mode.
