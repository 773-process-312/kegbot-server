Getting Involved
================

Because Kegbot is not a commercial venture, we rely on users like you to help
make it better.  As with any open source project, we invite you to participate
in the Kegbot community and help us make Kegbot better.


Forums
------

We are experimenting with discussion groups over at the `Kegbot Forums
<http://kegbot.org/kegbb/>`_.  The forums are open to all users, and we hope
they will be a resource of knowlege about building and running a Kegbot.  If you
are looking for help getting started, this should be your first stop.



Bug reports
-----------

Please visit the `Kegbot Bugs Database
<http://code.google.com/p/kegbot/issues/list>`_ at our Google Code site to
browse and report bugs.  In addition to problem reports, we welcome patches
and improvements to the Kegbot code.


IRC
---

Kegbot maintains an IRC channel on the `Freenode 
<http://freenode.net>`_ network: #kegbot.  Drop by and say hi.


Developers
----------

We're hungry for contributors!  The best way to get involved is to submit a
patch or add a new feature.  If you would like to contribute but don't know why
to start, ask around in the forums or on IRC.  (We'd like to have a better
developer guide soon.)
