WHAT IS HERE?

   This is the source tree for the kegbot controller code. This is a bunch of
   python stuff that forms the glue between the Kegboard controller board and
   the back end (presently a MySQL database.)

HACKING KEGBOT

   Some of this code could be improved. Parts are painfully old, lack any design
   or coherence, etc. It is probably true that some stuff has crept in to the
   code while, ah, 'debugging' the kegerator. I do have some plans to move
   things to a modular and event-driven runtime, more suitable for add-ons and
   such, but I haven't had much time to see this to fruition.

HOW TO SETUP KEGBOT

   Kegbot isn't quite there yet with a nice general-purpose installer, but try
   running 'configure.py' and see how far you get.

HOW TO RUN KEGBOT

   $ python kegbot.py
