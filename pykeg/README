WHAT IS HERE?

   This is the source tree for the kegbot controller code. This is a bunch of
   python stuff that forms the glue between the Kegboard controller board and
   the back end (presently a MySQL database.)

HOW TO SETUP KEGBOT

   Kegbot isn't quite there yet with a nice general-purpose installer, but try
   running 'configure.py' and see how far you get.

HOW TO RUN KEGBOT

   $ python kegbot.py
