HIGH PRIORITY

AVERAGE PRIORITY

- rework calibration script and make it easier to apply to current keg/pours
- add 'invalidate last pour' menu to LCD ui
- fix up RPC hooks
  * goes along with general modularization tack..
- improve the setup script
  * try to anticipate all possible problems
  * automate the routine, boring stuff
- improve the DB schema update script
  * perhaps a good place to use TDD
- per-keg grants
- clean up UI; KegUI is a mess (and pymtxorb/pylcdui too); better support other
  displays
- anonymous flows: support for channels to initiate flows without an
  authentication module to support it; this would be useful for valveless
  setups, where we have to notice the flowmeter 'just starts' ticking
