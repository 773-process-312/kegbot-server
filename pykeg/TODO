kegbot TODO

HIGH PRIORITY
   - get rid of drink fragments and change the flow loop so that the maximum
     amount pourable is calculated a priori; calculate the cost later or offline
   - unify keg.tick_metric and config.tick_metric so that only one is used.
   - add hooks to the main flow sequence so it is easier to hook in other
     authentication modules or steps

AVERAGE PRIORITY
   - rework calibration script and make it easier to apply to current keg/pours
   - add 'invalidate last pour' menu to LCD ui
   - fix BAC values so they can be recalculated if configuration changes
   - (ongoing) clean up and document stuff

LOW PRIORITY
   - (frontend) move functionality to smarty registered functions
