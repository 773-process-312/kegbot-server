HIGH PRIORITY
- document & fix the flow state machine
- per keg grants (has this feature really been missing for this long?)
- clean up drink post-processing -- right now functions are a mix of
  drink.DoSomething() and SomeModel.DoSomething(drink)
- better checking for UserProfile existence

AVERAGE PRIORITY

- rework calibration script and make it easier to apply to current keg/pours
- add 'invalidate last pour' menu to LCD ui
- fix up RPC hooks
  * goes along with general modularization tack..
- per-keg grants
- clean up UI; KegUI is a mess (and pymtxorb/pylcdui too); better support other
  displays
- sqlobject MultipleJoins -- use for grants; RelatedJoins -- use for lables
- use sqlobject alternateID where appropriate
- make auth devices take a list of channels, so that their eventsmay be
  associated only with a particular channel
