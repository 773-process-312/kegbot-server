* clean up template and code mixture
   - it is really messy right now
   - [in progress] smarty "componentized templates" are a better solution for a
     lot of the code/html embedded in the current set of tpls

* fix graphing

* cache data (tie in with frontend)
   - drinker totals should be recomputed each drink, _not_ by the frontend!
   - customization in the frontend should still be possible, but common
     calculations (especially periodic ones) should have a real owner

* multi-keg sane

* selectable units display, not just ounces (javascript magic?)

* go over everything with a style brush
   - my php 'style' sucks

* remove or fix support for multiple backends served by same frontend
   - it is quite hacky right now, and some things are broken: ie user mugshot
     syncing, etc..

* lots of other stuff i'll remember once i start trying to make this work again
  :)
